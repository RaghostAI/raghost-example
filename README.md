# What is RagHost?

RagHost lets you rapidly build production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines with an easy-to-use API.

You can embed documents using `/embed`, and query your document collections using `/query`.

# Getting Started

1. Copy the `.env.example` file.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add your RagHost API key under `RAGHOST_API_KEY` to your `.env` file. You can get this API key from raghost.ai by signing up for an account and going to the **Settings** page.

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
