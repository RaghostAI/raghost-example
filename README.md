In this example, we have already uploaded 35 documents to a collection on RagHost using `/embed`, and this interface lets the user query the document collection.

## What is RagHost?

RagHost lets you rapidly build production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines with an easy-to-use API.

You can embed documents using `/embed`, and query your document collections using `/ask`.

4. Go to the [RagHost Playground Page](https://raghost.ai/playground) and embed a document by uploading a PDF.

5. Copy the `Collection ID`, go to the file `pages/index.tsx`, and edit this line:

   ```html
   <QueryBlock collectionId="clot64hmt0009nc23wo4w9y8h" />
   ```

to be this, with your Collection ID:

    ```html
    <QueryBlock collectionId="<your-collection-id>" />
